## Project Management with Trello:

We utilize Trello for project management to keep our tasks organized and track progress visually.

`Task Organization`: Trello's boards, lists, and cards provide a visual representation of our project's workflow. We create boards for each project and populate them with lists representing different stages of our development process (e.g., Back Log, To Do, In Progress, Code Review, Documentation, Complete). Each card represents a task or user story, allowing us to break down work into manageable chunks.

[![Trello Image 3](src/assets/readme-imgs/trello-imgs/trello-img-1.JPG)](src/assets/readme-imgs/trello-imgs/trello-img-1.JPG)

[![Trello Image 2](src/assets/readme-imgs/trello-imgs/trello-img-2.JPG)](src/assets/readme-imgs/trello-imgs/trello-img-2.JPG)

`Assigning and Prioritizing Tasks`: Team members can assign themselves to cards and prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency. We use labels, due dates, and checklists to provide additional context and ensure that everyone knows what needs to be done and when.

`Tracking Progress`: Trello's kanban-style boards make it easy to visualize the status of each task and track progress as work moves through the workflow. We regularly review our boards during standup meetings to identify bottlenecks, reassign tasks, and ensure that we're on track to meet our goals.

## Version Control with GitHub:

Our team leverages GitHub extensively for version control, enabling us to manage code changes efficiently across our projects. Through GitHub repositories, we maintain a centralized repository for the project, allowing team members to collaborate seamlessly. Here's how we use GitHub:

`Branching Strategy`: We follow a branching strategy such as GitFlow, where we have a main branch representing production-ready code and feature branches for development work. When starting work on a new feature or bug fix, team members create a new branch (`git checkout -b "new-branch-name"`) from main and work on their changes locally.

`Adding and Committing Changes`: As team members work on their branches, they make frequent adds and commits (`git add .` & `git commit -m "commit-message"`) to document their progress. We encourage descriptive commit messages that provide context about the changes being made. This helps in understanding the purpose of each change and facilitates easier code reviews.

`Pushing Changes`: Once the changes are ready for review, team members push their branches (`git push`) to the remote repository on GitHub. This makes their changes accessible to other team members for review and collaboration. By pushing changes regularly, we ensure that everyone has access to the latest codebase and can stay up-to-date with the project's progress.

`Code Review Process`: Pull requests (PRs) are created when a feature or bug fix is ready for review. Team members can review the code, leave comments, and suggest improvements directly within the PR interface on GitHub. We strive for a collaborative and constructive code review process, where feedback is provided respectfully and improvements are made iteratively.

`Merge and Deployment`: Once a pull request has been reviewed and approved by team members, it is merged into the main codebase. Depending on our deployment strategy, the changes are then deployed to staging or production environments automatically or manually.

`Fetching Updates`: Finally, in our IDE terminal, we execute `git pull` to retrieve the latest updates from GitHub. This ensures that our local repository is synchronized with the remote one and th codebase remain clean, stable, and well-documented. With this step completed, the process begins anew.

  - MongoDB Atlas serves as the cloud-based database for storing class courses, professor details, and course reviews.
  - Amplify backend functions connect securely to MongoDB Atlas using credentials and interact with the database using the MongoDB Node.js driver.

- Authentication with Google Auth API:

  - Google Auth API is used for authentication and authorization.
  - UNCC students authenticate using their Google accounts, ensuring only authorized users can access the app.
  - Upon successful authentication, users receive a token allowing access to protected routes and resources.

- Authorization and User Management:

  - Amplify functions verify tokens issued by Google Auth API to authorize access to protected routes and resources.
  - User management, including role-based access control (if needed), can be handled within the application logic.

#### Persistent Data Storage:

For persistent data storage in our project, we utilize MongoDB Atlas, a fully managed cloud database service. MongoDB Atlas offers a flexible and scalable solution for storing and querying data in a NoSQL document format.

#### Global Control Flow:

NinerRate operates as an event-driven system, specifically tailored for the unique context of a university course review platform intended for UNC Charlotte students. While it offers a structured navigation path (home page, search, browse, login, review submission), the system does not enforce a linear, procedural workflow on its users. Instead, actions within NinerRate are triggered by user events such as logging in, searching for courses or instructors, and submitting reviews. This event-driven approach ensures a flexible and user-centric experience, accommodating the varied needs and preferences of UNCC students.

#### Time Dependency:

Our system incorporates time-dependent features, albeit not in the strict sense of a real-time system. Time-sensitive operations, such as session timeouts for logged-in users and periodic updates to course ratings based on new reviews, are implemented to enhance usability and data integrity. These operations are not real-time but are designed to execute within acceptable time frames that ensure a seamless user experience and up-to-date information display.

#### Concurrency:

Given the single-processor deployment architecture of NinerRate, our approach to concurrency is managed at the application level rather than through multi-threading at the system level. The Next.js framework, complemented by the MongoDB Atlas database, handles concurrent user actions (e.g., multiple users accessing course reviews, submitting reviews, or browsing instructor profiles simultaneously) efficiently. This is achieved through asynchronous I/O operations and event-loop management inherent in the Node.js environment, ensuring that the application remains responsive and scalable under varying loads.

Through the use of Component-Based Architecture, NinerRate ensures modularity and ease of component reuse, facilitating efficient handling of concurrent user interactions within the constraints of a single-processor system. Components such as user authentication (via NextAuth), course and instructor data retrieval, and review submission are designed to operate independently and seamlessly integrate, providing a robust and efficient user experience.
