Experience with digital design and fabrication is about how computing connects to the physical world. Computing is increasingly integrated into everyday life, and a big part of that is in the design of physical objects that we interact with on a daily basis. If you want to develop new internet-of-things devices, you need to be able to create the things - alongside the hardware and software. If you want to design smart clothes, toys, prosthetics, instruments, longboards, robots and much more, then you need to prototype both the physical components and tangible interactions.
